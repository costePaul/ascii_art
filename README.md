# ascii_art

`ascii_grey.py` is a python script that will turn the input image pixels into ascii character. The output is a txt file in the same directory as the image you plugged in with the same name. 

`ascii_colors.py` is a python script that will turn the input image pixels into ascii characters with some colors. The ouput is in the console as colors can't be transfered to a txt file. (In order to view the results when using a large resolution you can copy paste the ouput to a text editor managing colors such as Worrd or Pages, and then reduce the font size to 1).  

You can select the width you want for the output (it will define its resolution).
